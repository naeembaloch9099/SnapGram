# Frontend local env example
# Set the API base URL your frontend should use in production or when you
# want the client to call the backend directly instead of relying on the
# Vite dev proxy. Example (Railway):
VITE_API_URL=https://snapserver-production.up.railway.app/api

# During local development you can override the Vite dev server proxy
# target so requests to `/api/*` are forwarded to your local backend.
# Set this to http://localhost:4000 to use a local server instead of
# the default Railway target in `vite.config.js`.
# Example for local dev:
# VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:4000

# Optional: explicitly configure websocket origin if needed
# VITE_WS_URL=wss://snapserver-production.up.railway.app
